When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you would be working with others remotely so everyone can have access to the
  files at anytime.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This makes the user aware of any and all changes that will be overwriting into the remote
	repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are used when you want to make changes to a repository you don't have permission to
	change. Clones are used when you want to make an exact copy of a repository from a remote
	to online or vice versa. Branches are when you want to make alternate changes and develop
	paralle to the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	For easy editing whilst offline as well as being able to back up to it.
