When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you would be working with others remotely so everyone can have access to the
  files at anytime.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This makes the user aware of any and all changes that will be overwriting into the remote
	repository.
